              >Recipe design system</a
            >. Recipe is a highly structured, well documented, and discoverable
            design system that reduces time spent building front end
            experiences. It has reduced duplicated effort across ezCater's
            growing development team, accelerated the creation of design and
            engineering prototypes, and created a common "language" of
            components to improve consistency and brand awareness. Often
            neglected concerns like responsive design and accessibility are now
            able to be managed centrally, improving cross-squad ability to
            coordinate changes efficiently.

            Architected, designed and implemented an optimized
            <strong>offline synchronization</strong> mechanism for
            LiquidFrameworks’ FieldFX mobile platform. This eliminated lengthy
            sync sessions, reducing average sync times down to seconds where
            they previously took tens of minutes. This provided a significant
            competitive advantage for the FieldFX product.
